1) What is the name of the version control system we use in this course?



Bonus: Give the name for another version control system.



2) We refer to sites that host source code as "forges".  What is the name of
the primary forge used in this course?



For the next several questions, rearrange the items in the column on the
right, as necessary, so that they best match the names of key figures in the
column on the left.

For example:

B) 1776                       b) Second Defenestration of Prague
C) 1812                       c) United States' Declaration of Independence

5) I've presented "the four R's" as a shorthand for the freedoms attached to
software for it to be considered "free and open source".  List or describe
each.  (If you cannot remember the "r term" I use, but can describe the
freedom involved, that also counts.)
