Fall 2016, Quiz #1

1) What is the name of the version control system we use in this course?



Bonus: Give the name for another version control system.



2) We refer to sites that host source code as "forges".  What is the name of
the primary forge used in this course?



For the next several questions, rearrange the items in the column on the
right, as necessary, so that they best match the names of key figures in the
column on the left.

For example:

A) 1618                       a) War of 1812
B) 1776                       b) Second Defenestration of Prague
C) 1812                       c) United States' Declaration of Independence

becomes

A) 1618                       a) Second Defenestration of Prague
B) 1776                       b) United States' Declaration of Independence
C) 1812                       c) War of 1812



3) So, rearrange these to make the best matches:

B) 1991                 b) Free Software Foundation established

D) 2006                 d) first announcement of what was to become Linux 
     



4) We discussed several concepts involving rights, restrictions, and
licensing. Match the term on the left with the most appropriate description
on the right.

F) patent                             f) protects consumers from confusing one product with another



5) I've presented "the four R's" as a shorthand for the freedoms attached to
software for it to be considered "free and open source".  List or describe
each.  (If you cannot remember the "r term" I use, but can describe the
freedom involved, that also counts.)
