1) What is the name of the version control system we use in this course?



Bonus: Give the name for another version control system.



2) We refer to sites that host source code as "forges".  What is the name of
the primary forge used in this course?



For the next several questions, rearrange the items in the column on the
right, as necessary, so that they best match the names of key figures in the
column on the left.

For example:

A) Randall Munroe                    a) Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal
B) Zach Weiner                       b) XKCD
C) Walt Disney                       c) Mickey Mouse

becomes

A) Randall Munroe                    b) XKCD
B) Zach Weiner                       a) Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal
C) Walt Disney                       c) Mickey Mouse


3) So, rearrange these to make the best matches:

A) Andrew Tannenbaum                 a) Debian Free Software Guidelines
B) Linus Torvalds                    b) Free Software Foundation/Gnu Project
C) Bruce Perens                      c) Linux 
D) Richard Stallman                  d) Minix 
     




4) We discussed several concepts involving rights, restrictions, and
licensing. Match the term on the left with the most appropriate description
on the right.


A) trademark                          a) 20 year term
B) copyright                          b) lasts as long as used & defended
C) patent                             c) life of the author plus 70 years

D) trademark                          d) arises as soon as a work takes tangible form
E) copyright                          e) precedence is given to the first to file an application
F) patent                             f) protects consumers from confusing one product with another


5) I've presented "the four R's" as a shorthand for the freedoms attached to
software for it to be considered "free and open source".  List or describe
each.  (If you cannot remember the "r term" I use, but can describe the
freedom involved, that also counts.)
