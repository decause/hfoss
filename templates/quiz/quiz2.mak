10) We've discussed "the four R's" as a shorthand for the freedoms attached
to software for it to be considered "free" or "open source".  List or
describe each.  (eg, if you can remember the "r" word you can just give
that.  If you cannot remember the term, but can describe the freedom
involved, that also counts).  Various "r" words are roughly
synonymous for some of the freedoms, but we're counting freedoms here, not
synonyms so if you give two (or more) terms for the same freedom, it only
counts once.  For the purposes of this quiz, "remix" does not count as
describing any of them. (1pt each)
