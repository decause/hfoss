This is the content repository for the [RIT](https://rit.edu) [Department of Interactive Games and Media](http://igm.rit.edu)
__Humanitarian Free/Open Source Software Course__ (HFOSS). This course is a
__required__ part of the RIT [Academic Minor](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/igm/free-open-source-software-foss-mn) in
[Free/Open Source Software and Free Culture](http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=50590). 

The directory [ofcourse-content](orcourse-content) contains that subset of course-specific content served by an
instance of the [ofCourse](http://github.com/FOSSRIT/ofCourse) courseware, distributed
and maintained separately at [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ofcourse](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ofcourse).

The [assets](assets) directory contains local copies of **open educational resources** ([Creative Commons](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/What_is_OER%3F), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources),
[opensource.com](https://opensource.com/education/13/4/guide-open-source-education)) either used directly by the course or useful as references or for further
reading. It also includes binary objects (pictures, video) used in the course (eg, the course wiki).

The [docs](docs) directory may eventually contain course content (possibly
originating from the course wiki) served via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or
another, similar static content hosting system.
